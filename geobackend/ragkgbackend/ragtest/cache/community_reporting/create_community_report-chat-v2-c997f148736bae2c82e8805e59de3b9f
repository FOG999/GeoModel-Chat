This role will involve mapping social networks, identifying key entities, and understanding the dynamics of collaboration and knowledge sharing among geoscientists, researchers, industry professionals, and academic institutions. The analyst will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to assess community structure, facilitate communication, and promote collaborative initiatives that enhance research and development in geological sciences. The findings will be used to inform decision-makers about significant developments within the community and their potential impact on geological research, education, and industry practices.. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.\n\n# Report Structure\nThe report should include the following sections:\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.\n- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance of the text to geological sciences, community dynamics, sedimentology, and the classification of sedimentary structures, with 1 being trivial or irrelevant and 10 being highly significant, impactful, and essential for understanding sedimentary processes and community interactions within the field.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.\n    {\n        \"title\": \"<report_title>\",\n        \"summary\": \"<executive_summary>\",\n        \"rating\": <threat_severity_rating>,\n        \"rating_explanation\": \"<rating_explanation>\"\n        \"findings\": \"[{\"summary\":\"<insight_1_summary>\", \"explanation\": \"<insight_1_explanation\"}, {\"summary\":\"<insight_2_summary>\", \"explanation\": \"<insight_2_explanation\"}]\"\n    }\n\n# Grounding Rules\nAfter each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.\nEach paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities.
