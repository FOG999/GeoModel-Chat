Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

(3-4)\n式中   wd——点坝跨度,m ；\nw——河流满岸宽度,m。\n4）宽深比与侧积层倾角的关系\n前人曾对点坝侧积层倾角的控制因素进行过研究，对河流宽度及深度与倾角的关系进行 过分析。如刘站立、焦养泉等(1996)通过露头建立了河流宽度与侧积层倾角的相关关系，认 为河道越宽，则水流越浅，因而侧积作用形成的侧积层倾角越缓，反之，形成的侧积层倾角 相对较陡；Leeder(1973)通过河流的满岸深度来推算河流的满岸宽度，继而推算侧积层倾 角，认为河流满岸深度越大，侧积层倾角越大。然而，进一步研究表明，河流宽度及深度与 侧积层倾角的关系尚不明确，对于那些窄而浅与宽而深的河道，侧积层倾角可能相等。由于 侧积层是披覆于活动点坝的坝面而形成的，因而侧积层的倾角与坝面倾角相等，而坝面倾角 又受控于活动河道的河床底形。河流的宽深比是反映河床底形的重要参数。这意味着：从沉 积机理上讲，河流宽深比与侧积层倾角具有一定的关系\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
